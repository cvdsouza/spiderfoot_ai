%% RabbitMQ advanced configuration for SpiderFoot
%%
%% consumer_timeout undefined — disables the consumer acknowledgement timeout.
%% By default RabbitMQ 3.12+ closes the channel after 30 minutes if a consumer
%% has not acked a delivery, which kills the worker connection mid-scan for any
%% scan that takes longer than 30 minutes.  Scans are long-running by design.
%%
%% This cannot be set to 0 or false via rabbitmq.conf (it requires a positive
%% integer), so we use advanced.config instead.
