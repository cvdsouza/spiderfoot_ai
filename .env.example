# SpiderFoot environment configuration
# Copy this file to .env and edit the values:
#   cp .env.example .env

# ── Admin credentials ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These are used to create the initial administrator account on first startup.
# Once created, the password can be changed from the UI (Settings → Change Password).
# Changing these values after the first run has no effect — use the UI instead.

SPIDERFOOT_ADMIN_USER=admin
SPIDERFOOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SpiderFoot

# ── RabbitMQ (distributed workers — Phase 11) ─────────────────────────────────
# Scans are published to RabbitMQ and consumed by worker containers.
# If RabbitMQ is unreachable, scans fall back to running locally.
#
# TLS is enabled by default (amqps:// on port 5671). Self-signed certificates
# are generated automatically by ./start.sh and stored in certs/.
#
# RABBITMQ_URL — primary connection string. Change the hostname/credentials here
#   if pointing at an external broker. Use amqps:// for TLS (recommended).
#
# RABBITMQ_USER / RABBITMQ_PASS — credentials for the RabbitMQ container itself.
#   Must match the username:password embedded in RABBITMQ_URL.

RABBITMQ_URL=amqps://spiderfoot:spiderfoot@rabbitmq:5671/
RABBITMQ_USER=spiderfoot
RABBITMQ_PASS=spiderfoot

# ── Worker Management (Phase 12 — Stateless Workers) ─────────────────────────
# Automatic cleanup of offline workers from the database.
# Workers are stateless and automatically re-register on heartbeat, so it's safe
# to remove offline workers. They will reconnect and re-register when they come back.
#
# WORKER_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT — delete workers offline for longer than this (in seconds).
#   Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
#   Cleanup runs automatically every 2 minutes in the background.
#   You can also manually trigger cleanup via the "Refresh & Cleanup" button in the Workers UI.

WORKER_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT=300
